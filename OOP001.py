\\\Notes\\\

Structured Programming features:

-Breaking down a main problen into sub-problems
-Using functions and procedures to solve sub-problems
-The use of global and local varibales
-The use of parameters to pass data to functions or procedures

Object oriented programming develops these concepts futher by bundling functions/procedures
and their required data into a single unit. OOP can help to model the real world more
closely.

Simulation:

-Computer program or network of computers that attepmts to simulate a model
 of a particular system
-Computer simulations can represent real and imaginary situations.
-Simulations allow users to study or try things that would be difficult
 or impossible to do in real life.
 
A characteristic in a software object is called an attribute and a behaviour is
called a method. An attribute is similar to a varibale and a method is similar to
a function.

A CLASS is like a blueprint or a set of instructions. You can use instantiation which
is createing software objects from the class definition. All the objects will be
independant from each other but they share the same method and attributes as they come
from the same class. These "Clones" are called instances.
